1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - **Definition**: Depth-First Search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. One starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
   - **Strategy**: The algorithm begins at the root node and explores as far as possible down each branch before backtracking. Essentially, it goes deep before it goes wide.
   - **Data Structure**: DFS uses a stack (which can be implemented with recursion) to keep track of which vertices to visit next.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - **Definition**: Breadth-First Search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root and explores the neighbor nodes at the current depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
   - **Strategy**: BFS explores all of the neighbor nodes at the current depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It goes wide before it goes deep.
   - **Data Structure**: BFS uses a queue to keep track of which vertices to visit next.

Both DFS and BFS can be used to check for the existence of a path between two nodes, to find the shortest path, to detect cycles, among other problems. The choice between them often depends on the specific problem, the nature of the graph, and the kind of solution required.
