The "frontier" refers to the set of all nodes that are available for exploration but have not been explored yet. In other words, these are the nodes that have been discovered but whose neighbors have not been examined. As the search progresses, nodes are taken from the frontier, explored, and their neighbors (that haven't been discovered previously) are added to the frontier.

Here's a simple breakdown using BFS as an example:

1. Start with the initial node (or nodes) and add it to the frontier.
2. Remove a node from the frontier and examine it:
   a. If it's the goal node, the search is done.
   b. If it's not the goal node, add its neighbors to the frontier (provided they haven't been added to the frontier before and haven't been explored).
3. Repeat step 2 until the goal is found or the frontier is empty.

The frontier can be implemented using different data structures depending on the search algorithm:

- For BFS, a queue is used to ensure that nodes are explored in the order they are discovered.
- For Depth-First Search (DFS), a stack is used.
- For A* or other priority-based searches, a priority queue (often implemented using a heap) is used, where nodes with higher priorities (usually based on a heuristic value) are explored first.

In essence, when evaluating a node in the frontier, the search algorithm is determining if it should explore that node's neighbors and if the node itself satisfies the goal condition.
